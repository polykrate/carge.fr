Chaque acteur (distributeur, transporteur, détaillant) ajoute ses informations au fur et à mesure de l\'avancement du produit dans la chaîne. L\'ensemble est signé sur la blockchain. Le client scanne le QR code : si le produit correspond au certificat, il accède au parcours complet vérifié. Une preuve d\'authenticité simple et fiable.',

        faq2A: 'Non, aucune compétence technique n\'est requise. Notre interface web est aussi simple qu\'un site classique. Pour une intégration en entreprise, nous fournissons des APIs simples et pouvons connecter CARGE à vos systèmes existants (ERP, bases de données, etc.).',
        faq3Q: 'Est-ce sécurisé ?',
