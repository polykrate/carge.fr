Chaque acteur (distributeur, transporteur, détaillant) ajoute ses informations au fur et à mesure de l\'avancement du produit dans la chaîne. L\'ensemble est signé sur la blockchain. Le client scanne le QR code : si le produit correspond au certificat, il accède au parcours complet vérifié. Une preuve d\'authenticité simple et fiable.',
        faq2Q: 'Faut-il être développeur ?',
        faq2A: 'Non, aucune compétence technique n\'est requise. Notre interface web est aussi simple qu\'un site classique. Pour une intégration en entreprise, nous fournissons des APIs simples et pouvons connecter CARGE à vos systèmes existants (ERP, bases de données, etc.).',
        faq3Q: 'Est-ce sécurisé ?',
        faq3A: 'Oui, la sécurité est maximale. Le chiffrement utilisé est de niveau militaire (identique aux clés SSH). Vos clés privées ne quittent jamais votre appareil. Seules les empreintes cryptographiques sont enregistrées sur la blockchain, jamais vos données réelles.',
        faq4Q: 'Mes données sont-elles privées ?',
        faq4A: 'Absolument. Seuls vous et les personnes que vous autorisez explicitement peuvent déchiffrer le contenu. La blockchain ne stocke que des empreintes et des signatures, jamais les données brutes. Solution conforme au RGPD.',
        faq5Q: 'Quel est le coût ?',
        faq5A: 'La vérification est gratuite. La signature coûte environ 0,01 à 0,10 € par preuve (frais de transaction blockchain). Aucun abonnement, aucuns frais cachés. Des forfaits entreprise sont disponibles pour les volumes importants.',
        faq6Q: 'Quel est le délai d\'implémentation ?',
